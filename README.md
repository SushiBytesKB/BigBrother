# Big Brother

## üèÜ Tokyo Game Jam Hackathon Spring 2025 - First Place Winner üèÜ

## Introduction

**Big Brother** is a dynamic and ever-evolving card game that challenges players to adapt to new rules on the fly. Born out of a 48-hour hackathon, this project was the first-place winning entry at the Tokyo Game Jam Hackathon Spring 2025.

The core of "Big Brother" is its unique use of a large language model (LLM) to generate and simulate new rules in real-time. This creates a gameplay experience where no two games are ever the same, and players are kept on their toes, constantly trying to figure out the current set of rules.

## Gameplay

Inspired by the card game "Mao," the rules of "Big Brother" are not explicitly told to the players. Players must deduce the rules through trial and error. The twist is that the rules are not static. At any point, the AI can introduce new rules, modify existing ones, or remove them entirely, making for a chaotic and exciting experience.

## Features

* **Dynamic Rule Generation:** The game uses an AI to procedurally generate new rules during gameplay.
* **Ever-Evolving Gameplay:** The constantly changing rules ensure a high degree of replayability and a unique experience every time.
* **Real-time Rule Simulation:** The back-end infrastructure is designed to seamlessly integrate and simulate the new rules as they are generated.
* **AI Integration:** The core game logic is intertwined with the AI model to create the dynamic rule system.

## Tech Stack

* **Game Logic:** The core game logic and back-end infrastructure were custom-built for this project.
* **AI Model:** The procedural rule generation is powered by a large language model.
